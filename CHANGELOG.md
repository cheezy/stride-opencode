# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **`src/index.ts` (`extractEnvFromResponse`)** — Now handles the `{"stdout": "<api-json-string>", ...}` wrapper shape that some hosts use when passing the tool response to hooks. The function previously tried `parsed.data || parsed`, which missed the wrapper entirely — leaving `TASK_IDENTIFIER`/`TASK_TITLE` unset for downstream `.stride.md` commands. It now peels `.stdout` and parses the inner JSON as a first step, then falls back to the two legacy shapes (`{data:{...}}` and `{id:...}`).
- **`src/index.test.ts`** — New regression tests for the wrapped `tool_response.stdout` shape (wrapped with `.data` and wrapped flat).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- **`stride-claiming-tasks`** — Replaced soft "Recommended" orchestrator section with non-negotiable "YOUR NEXT STEP" gate demanding stride-workflow activation immediately after claiming. Added workflow violation warning to standalone mode.
- **`stride-completing-tasks`** — Added "BEFORE CALLING COMPLETE: Verification Checklist" with 4 yes/no items covering orchestrator activation, codebase exploration, acceptance criteria review, and hook readiness.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **`stride-workflow` skill** — Single orchestrator for the complete Stride task lifecycle adapted for OpenCode. Walks through prerequisites, claiming, codebase exploration (via custom agents with graceful fallback), implementation, code review, hooks, and completion in a single skill. Uses automatic hook execution via `tool.execute.before`/`tool.execute.after` and process-over-speed messaging.

### Changed

- **`stride-claiming-tasks` skill** — Reframed automation notice from throughput-emphasizing ("FULLY AUTOMATED") to process-over-speed ("The workflow IS the automation"). Added "Recommended: Use the Workflow Orchestrator" section. Renamed "MANDATORY: Next Skill After Claiming" to "Next Skill After Claiming (Standalone Mode)".
- **`stride-completing-tasks` skill** — Reframed automation notice to process-over-speed. Added "Arriving from stride-workflow" section. Renamed "MANDATORY: Previous Skill Before Completing" to "Previous Skill Before Completing (Standalone Mode)".
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Updated Workflow Sequence to recommend `stride-workflow` as preferred entry point.
- **`README.md`** — Added `stride-workflow` to Workflow Order and Skills table.
- **`package.json`** — Bumped version from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

**Plugin (`src/index.ts`)**
- TypeScript plugin with `tool.execute.before` and `tool.execute.after` hook handlers
- Automatic Stride API call detection for claim, complete, and mark_reviewed endpoints
- Hook routing: claim→before_doing, pre-complete→after_doing, post-complete→before_review, mark_reviewed→after_review
- Non-Stride commands pass through without intervention
- Missing `.stride.md` handled gracefully (no-op)

**Parser (`src/parser.ts`)**
- `.stride.md` parser supporting CRLF and LF line endings
- Extracts commands from `## section` + ````bash` code blocks
- Filters comments (lines starting with `#`) and blank lines
- Only captures first code block per section
- Handles adjacent sections, trailing whitespace, and missing trailing newlines

**Environment Variable Caching**
- Automatically extracts task metadata from claim API responses
- Caches `TASK_ID`, `TASK_IDENTIFIER`, `TASK_TITLE`, `TASK_STATUS`, `TASK_COMPLEXITY`, `TASK_PRIORITY`, `TASK_NEEDS_REVIEW`, `TASK_DESCRIPTION`
- Variables persist across hook invocations within a session
- Cache cleared after `after_review` (end of lifecycle)

**Skills (6)**
- `stride-claiming-tasks` — Task claiming with before_doing hook execution
- `stride-completing-tasks` — Task completion with after_doing and before_review hooks
- `stride-creating-tasks` — Task creation with field format validation
- `stride-creating-goals` — Goal and batch creation with dependency management
- `stride-enriching-tasks` — Automated codebase exploration to enrich minimal tasks
- `stride-subagent-workflow` — Decision matrix for agent dispatch based on complexity

**Agents (4)**
- `task-explorer` — Read-only codebase exploration for key_files and patterns
- `task-reviewer` — Code review against acceptance criteria, pitfalls, and patterns
- `task-decomposer` — Goal decomposition into dependency-ordered child tasks
- `hook-diagnostician` — Hook failure diagnosis with prioritized fix plans

**Configuration**
- `AGENTS.md` — OpenCode configuration bridge with skill activation rules and tool mapping
- `package.json` — npm package manifest (`opencode-stride`)
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript configuration for Bun runtime

**Documentation**
- `README.md` — Installation (npm and local), skill chain, hooks, agents, troubleshooting
- `CHANGELOG.md` — This file

**Tests**
- 49 tests across 2 test files using `bun:test` runner
- Parser tests: 21 tests covering all edge cases
- Plugin tests: 28 tests covering routing, filtering, and environment extraction
