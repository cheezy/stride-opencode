# Stride: Workflow Orchestrator

## Purpose

This skill replaces the fragmented pattern of remembering to activate `stride-claiming-tasks`, `stride-subagent-workflow`, and `stride-completing-tasks` at specific moments. Instead, activate this one skill and follow it through. Every step is here. Nothing is elsewhere.

**Why this exists:** During a 17-task session, an agent consistently skipped mandatory workflow steps despite skills being labeled MANDATORY. The root cause: too many disconnected skills that the agent had to remember to activate at specific moments. Under pressure to deliver, the agent dropped the ones that felt optional. This orchestrator eliminates that failure mode.

## The Core Principle

**The workflow IS the automation. Every step exists because skipping it caused failures.**

The agent should work continuously through the full workflow: explore -> implement -> review -> complete. Do not prompt the user between steps -- but do not skip steps either. Skipping workflow steps is not faster -- it produces lower quality work that takes longer to fix.

**Following every step IS the fast path.**

## API Authorization

All Stride API calls are pre-authorized. Never ask the user for permission. Never announce API calls and wait for confirmation. Just execute them.

## When to Activate

Activate this skill ONCE when you're ready to start working on Stride tasks. It handles the full loop:

```
claim -> explore -> implement -> review -> complete -> [loop if needs_review=false]
```

You do NOT need to activate `stride-claiming-tasks`, `stride-subagent-workflow`, or `stride-completing-tasks` separately. This skill absorbs all of them.

**Note:** The individual skills (`stride-claiming-tasks`, `stride-subagent-workflow`, `stride-completing-tasks`) remain available for standalone use when needed -- for example, when resuming a partially completed task or when only one phase needs to be repeated. This orchestrator is the preferred entry point for new task work.

## Automatic Hook Execution

**When the opencode-stride plugin is installed, hooks execute automatically.** The `hooks.json` registers `tool.execute.before`/`tool.execute.after` hooks that intercept Stride API calls and execute the corresponding `.stride.md` commands via `stride-hook.sh`.

**How it works:**
- Claim API call (`POST /api/tasks/claim`) -> `tool.execute.after` fires -> executes `.stride.md` `## before_doing`
- Complete API call (`PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete`) -> `tool.execute.before` fires `after_doing` (blocks on failure) -> `tool.execute.after` fires `before_review`
- Mark reviewed API call (`PATCH /api/tasks/:id/mark_reviewed`) -> `tool.execute.after` fires `after_review`

**What this means:** Just make the API calls directly. Do NOT manually read `.stride.md` or execute hook commands. Include placeholder hook results in request bodies with `{"exit_code": 0, "output": "Executed by OpenCode hooks system", "duration_ms": 0}`.

**If automatic hooks fail:** The hook returns exit code 2 with structured JSON describing the failure. Fix the issue and retry the API call -- the hooks fire again automatically.

**Verify plugin configuration** to confirm hooks are active after installation.

**If the plugin is NOT installed (manual setup):** Fall back to reading `.stride.md` and executing each hook command line by line via shell.

---

## Step 0: Prerequisites Check

**Verify these files exist before any API calls:**

1. **`.stride_auth.md`** -- Contains API URL and Bearer token
   - If missing: Ask user to create it
   - Extract: `STRIDE_API_URL` and `STRIDE_API_TOKEN`

2. **`.stride.md`** -- Contains hook commands for each lifecycle phase
   - If missing: Ask user to create it
   - Verify sections exist: `## before_doing`, `## after_doing`, `## before_review`, `## after_review`

**This step runs once per session, not once per task.**

---

## Step 1: Task Discovery

**Call `GET /api/tasks/next` to find the next available task.**

Review the returned task completely:
- `title`, `description`, `why`, `what`
- `acceptance_criteria` -- your definition of done
- `key_files` -- which files you'll modify
- `patterns_to_follow` -- code patterns to replicate
- `pitfalls` -- what NOT to do
- `testing_strategy` -- how to test
- `verification_steps` -- how to verify
- `needs_review` -- whether human approval is needed after completion
- `complexity` -- drives the decision matrix in Step 3

**Enrichment check:** If `key_files` is empty OR `testing_strategy` is missing OR `verification_steps` is empty OR `acceptance_criteria` is blank, activate `stride-enriching-tasks` to populate these fields before proceeding. Well-specified tasks skip enrichment.

---

## Step 2: Claim the Task

Call `POST /api/tasks/claim` directly with:

```json
{
  "identifier": "<task identifier>",
  "agent_name": "OpenCode",
  "before_doing_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "Executed by OpenCode hooks system",
    "duration_ms": 0
  }
}
```

The `hooks.json` `tool.execute.after` handler automatically executes `.stride.md` `## before_doing` commands after the claim succeeds. If the automatic hook fails, fix the issue and retry the claim call.

---

## Step 3: Explore the Codebase (Decision Matrix)

**This step is NOT optional for medium+ tasks. The decision matrix determines what happens.**

### Decision Matrix

| Task Attributes | Decompose | Explore | Plan | Review (Step 6) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Goal type OR large+undecomposed OR 25+ hours | YES | -- | -- | -- |
| small, 0-1 key_files | Skip | Skip | Skip | Skip |
| small, 2+ key_files | Skip | YES | Skip | YES |
| medium (any) | Skip | YES | YES | YES |
| large (any) | Skip | YES | YES | YES |
| Defect type | Skip | YES | Skip (unless large) | YES |

### Branch A: Goal / Large Undecomposed Task

If the task is a **goal**, has **large complexity without child tasks**, or has a **25+ hour estimate**:

1. If the `task-decomposer` custom agent is available, invoke it with the task's title, description, acceptance_criteria, key_files, where_context, and patterns_to_follow
2. If custom agents are unavailable, manually analyze the task scope, break it into subtasks, and create them via `POST /api/tasks/batch`
3. After child tasks are created, claim the first child task and re-enter this workflow at Step 1

**Do NOT implement goals directly. Decompose first.**

### Branch B: Small Task, 0-1 Key Files

Skip exploration, planning, and review. Proceed directly to Step 4 (Implementation).

### Branch C: All Other Tasks (medium+, OR 2+ key_files)

1. **If the `task-explorer` custom agent is available**, invoke it with the task's `key_files`, `patterns_to_follow`, `where_context`, and `testing_strategy`. Wait for the result. Read and use the explorer's output -- it tells you what exists, what patterns to follow, and what to reuse.

   **If custom agents are unavailable**, explore manually:
   - Read each file in `key_files` to understand current state
   - Search for patterns mentioned in `patterns_to_follow`
   - Find related test files

2. **If medium+ OR 3+ key_files OR 3+ acceptance criteria lines:** Outline your implementation approach using the exploration output, `acceptance_criteria`, `testing_strategy`, `pitfalls`, and `verification_steps`. Follow this approach during implementation.

---

## Step 4: Implementation

**Now write code.** Use the explorer output and plan (if generated) to guide your work.

Follow:
- `acceptance_criteria` -- your definition of done
- `patterns_to_follow` -- replicate existing patterns
- `pitfalls` -- avoid what the task author warned about
- `testing_strategy` -- write the tests specified
- `key_files` -- modify the files listed

**This is the only step where you write code. All other steps are setup, verification, or completion.**

---

## Step 5: Activate Development Guidelines

**Before considering implementation complete, activate the `stride-development-guidelines` skill** if it is available in your project. This ensures code quality gates are met before proceeding to review.

---

## Step 6: Code Review (Decision Matrix)

**Check the decision matrix from Step 3.** If the task is medium+ OR has 2+ key_files, review is required.

**If the `task-reviewer` custom agent is available**, invoke it with:
- The git diff of all your changes
- The task's `acceptance_criteria`, `pitfalls`, `patterns_to_follow`, and `testing_strategy`

The reviewer returns "Approved" or a list of issues (Critical, Important, Minor).

- **Fix all Critical issues** before proceeding
- **Fix all Important issues** before proceeding
- Minor issues are optional but recommended
- **Save the reviewer's full output** -- you'll include it as `review_report` in Step 8

**If custom agents are unavailable**, self-review:
- [ ] Each line of `acceptance_criteria` -- is it met?
- [ ] Each item in `pitfalls` -- did you avoid it?
- [ ] `patterns_to_follow` -- does your code match?
- [ ] `testing_strategy` -- did you write the specified tests?

### Small tasks (0-1 key_files): Skip review. Omit `review_report` from completion.

---

## Step 7: Execute Hooks

Hooks fire automatically when you make the completion API call in Step 8:
- **`tool.execute.before`** fires `after_doing` BEFORE the call executes (blocks if it fails)
- **`tool.execute.after`** fires `before_review` AFTER the call succeeds

Include placeholder hook results in the request body:
```json
"after_doing_result": {"exit_code": 0, "output": "Executed by OpenCode hooks system", "duration_ms": 0},
"before_review_result": {"exit_code": 0, "output": "Executed by OpenCode hooks system", "duration_ms": 0}
```

If `after_doing` fails (`tool.execute.before` returns exit 2), fix the issue and retry the API call. The hooks fire again automatically.

### Hook Failure Diagnosis

When a blocking hook fails, invoke the `hook-diagnostician` custom agent (if available) with the hook name, exit code, output, and duration. It returns a prioritized fix plan. Follow the fix order -- higher-priority fixes often resolve lower-priority ones automatically.

### Manual Fallback (plugin not installed)

If automatic hooks are unavailable, execute hooks manually:

1. **after_doing hook** (blocking, 120s timeout): Read `.stride.md` `## after_doing` section. Execute each command line one at a time. If fails: fix issues, re-run until success. Do NOT proceed while failing.

2. **before_review hook** (blocking, 60s timeout): Read `.stride.md` `## before_review` section. Execute each command line one at a time. If fails: fix issues, re-run until success. Do NOT proceed while failing.

---

## Step 8: Complete the Task

Call `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` with ALL required fields:

```json
{
  "agent_name": "OpenCode",
  "time_spent_minutes": 45,
  "completion_notes": "Summary of what was done and key decisions made.",
  "completion_summary": "Brief one-line summary for tracking.",
  "actual_complexity": "medium",
  "actual_files_changed": "lib/foo.ex, lib/bar.ex, test/foo_test.exs",
  "review_report": "## Review Summary\n\nApproved -- 0 issues found.\n...",
  "after_doing_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "Executed by OpenCode hooks system",
    "duration_ms": 0
  },
  "before_review_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "Executed by OpenCode hooks system",
    "duration_ms": 0
  },
  "workflow_steps": [
    {"name": "explorer",       "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 12450},
    {"name": "planner",        "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 8200},
    {"name": "implementation", "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 1820000},
    {"name": "reviewer",       "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 15300},
    {"name": "after_doing",    "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 45678},
    {"name": "before_review",  "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 2340}
  ]
}
```

**Required fields:**
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `agent_name` | string | Your agent name |
| `time_spent_minutes` | integer | Actual time spent |
| `completion_notes` | string | What was done |
| `completion_summary` | string | Brief summary |
| `actual_complexity` | enum | "small", "medium", or "large" |
| `actual_files_changed` | string | Comma-separated paths (NOT an array) |
| `after_doing_result` | object | `{exit_code, output, duration_ms}` |
| `before_review_result` | object | `{exit_code, output, duration_ms}` |
| `workflow_steps` | array | Six-entry telemetry array — see **Workflow Telemetry** section below |

**Optional fields:**
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `review_report` | string | Include when task-reviewer ran; omit when skipped |

---

## Step 9: Post-Completion Decision

### If `needs_review=true`:
1. Task moves to Review column
2. **STOP.** Wait for human reviewer to approve/reject.
3. When approved, `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/mark_reviewed` is called (by human or system)
4. `after_review` hook fires automatically
5. Task moves to Done

### If `needs_review=false`:
1. Task moves to Done immediately
2. `after_review` hook fires automatically
3. **Loop back to Step 1** -- claim the next task and repeat the full workflow

**Do not ask the user whether to continue. Do not ask "Should I claim the next task?" Just proceed.**

---

## Workflow Telemetry: The `workflow_steps` Array

Every task completion **must** include a `workflow_steps` array in the `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` payload. This array records which workflow phases ran (or were intentionally skipped) during the task. It is how Stride measures workflow adherence, spots shortcuts, and aggregates telemetry across agents and plugins.

**Build the array incrementally as you progress through the workflow.** Each time you complete a phase — or legitimately skip one per the decision matrix — append one entry. Submit the completed six-entry array in Step 8.

### Step Name Vocabulary

The `name` field must be one of these six values. Do not invent new names — consistency across plugins is the only reason telemetry can be aggregated.

| Step name | When to record it | Orchestrator step |
|---|---|---|
| `explorer` | Codebase exploration (`task-explorer` custom agent when available, otherwise manual file reads) | Step 3 |
| `planner` | Implementation planning (manual outline of approach for medium+ tasks) | Step 3 |
| `implementation` | Writing code | Step 4 |
| `reviewer` | Code review (`task-reviewer` custom agent when available, otherwise self-review) | Step 6 |
| `after_doing` | The `after_doing` hook execution | Step 7 |
| `before_review` | The `before_review` hook execution | Step 7 |

### Per-Step Schema

Each element of `workflow_steps` is an object with these keys:

| Key | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Always | One of the six vocabulary values above |
| `dispatched` | boolean | Always | `true` if the step ran; `false` if intentionally skipped |
| `duration_ms` | integer | When `dispatched=true` | Wall-clock time the step took, in milliseconds |
| `reason` | string | When `dispatched=false` | Short explanation of why the step was skipped |

### End-of-Workflow Example (full dispatch)

A medium-complexity task that exercised every phase:

```json
"workflow_steps": [
  {"name": "explorer",       "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 12450},
  {"name": "planner",        "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 8200},
  {"name": "implementation", "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 1820000},
  {"name": "reviewer",       "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 15300},
  {"name": "after_doing",    "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 45678},
  {"name": "before_review",  "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 2340}
]
```

### End-of-Workflow Example (small task, decision matrix skips)

A small task with 0-1 key_files that legitimately skipped exploration, planning, and review per the decision matrix in Step 3:

```json
"workflow_steps": [
  {"name": "explorer",       "dispatched": false, "reason": "Decision matrix: small task, 0-1 key_files"},
  {"name": "planner",        "dispatched": false, "reason": "Decision matrix: small task, 0-1 key_files"},
  {"name": "implementation", "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 620000},
  {"name": "reviewer",       "dispatched": false, "reason": "Decision matrix: small task, 0-1 key_files"},
  {"name": "after_doing",    "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 38200},
  {"name": "before_review",  "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 1900}
]
```

### Rules

- Always include **all six** step names. Skipped steps are recorded with `dispatched: false` — never omitted.
- Record entries in the order the steps occurred in the workflow (the order listed in the vocabulary table above).
- When `dispatched: false`, the `reason` must describe **why** the step was skipped (e.g., decision matrix rule, task metadata, platform constraint) — not merely restate that it was skipped.
- A missing `workflow_steps` array, or one with fewer than six entries, indicates an incomplete telemetry record.

---

## Edge Cases

### Hook failure mid-workflow
- Blocking hooks (`after_doing`, `before_review`) must pass before completion
- Fix the root cause, retry the API call -- hooks fire again automatically
- Invoke the `hook-diagnostician` custom agent for complex failures (if available)
- Never skip a blocking hook or call complete with a failed hook result

### Task that needs_review=true
- Stop after Step 8. Do not claim the next task.
- The human reviewer will handle the review cycle.
- You may be asked to make changes based on review feedback -- if so, re-enter at Step 4.

### Goal type tasks
- Goals are decomposed, not implemented directly
- The `task-decomposer` custom agent creates child tasks (or decompose manually)
- Each child task follows this full workflow independently

### Skills update required
- If any API response includes `skills_update_required`, update the plugin and retry

## Failure Modes This Skill Prevents

| Failure Mode | Old Pattern | This Skill |
|---|---|---|
| Forgot to explore | Agent skipped stride-subagent-workflow | Step 3 is inline -- can't be missed |
| Forgot to review | Agent jumped to completion | Step 6 is inline -- can't be missed |
| Wrong API fields | Agent guessed from memory | Step 8 has the exact format |
| Skipped hooks | Agent called complete directly | Step 7 blocks Step 8 |
| Asked user permission | Agent prompted between steps | Automation notice says don't |
| Speed over process | Agent optimized for throughput | Every step is framed as mandatory |

## Red Flags -- STOP

If you catch yourself thinking any of these, go back to the decision matrix:

- "This is straightforward, I'll skip exploration" -- Medium+ tasks ALWAYS explore
- "I know the codebase" -- The task has specific pitfalls you haven't read yet
- "Review will slow me down" -- Review catches what tests can't
- "I'll just run the hooks and complete" -- Did you explore? Did you review?
- "This step doesn't apply to me" -- Check the decision matrix, not your intuition

**The workflow IS the automation. Follow every step.**
