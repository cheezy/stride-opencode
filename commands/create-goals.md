# /create-goals

Create a Stride goal with nested tasks, optionally informed by a directory of project markdown. This is the OpenCode surface for stride's context-informed creation (the canonical reference calls it `/stride:create-goals`). It parses `$ARGUMENTS`, optionally loads a read-only markdown **context bundle** from `--dir`, then routes through the **`stride-workflow`** orchestrator, which dispatches the `stride-creating-goals` sub-skill. The batch contract — the `"goals"` root key, index-based dependencies, and the four review_queue-scored fields on every nested task — lives in `skills/stride-creating-goals/SKILL.md` and is enforced there.

**This command never activates `stride-creating-goals` directly** — the sub-skill gate would block that. It always goes through `stride-workflow`, which writes the activation marker that permits the dispatch.

This command is the goal-creating sibling of `/create-tasks`; the `$ARGUMENTS` parsing and `--dir` validation below are intentionally identical so the two stay parallel.

When you need to run shell, execute it with `shell`, one command at a time, checking the result before proceeding.

## What to do

### Step 1: Parse `$ARGUMENTS`

The user invoked you with `$ARGUMENTS`. Parse in this fixed order — `--dir` (alias `--context`) first, then everything remaining is the free-text **creation intent** (the goal description):

- If `--dir` or `--context` appears, set `CONTEXT_DIR` to its value and remove the consumed token(s). Accept BOTH shapes:
  - `--dir <value>` / `--context <value>` — the value is the **next** token.
  - `--dir=<value>` / `--context=<value>` — the value is the substring after `=`.
- Everything left after removing the flag is `INTENT` (the natural-language description of the goal to create). `INTENT` MAY be empty — the orchestrator and sub-skill will gather it interactively.

### Step 2: Validate the context directory

Only when `CONTEXT_DIR` is set, run this via `shell`:

```bash
if [ -n "$CONTEXT_DIR" ]; then
  if [ ! -d "$CONTEXT_DIR" ]; then
    echo "create-goals: --dir path does not exist or is not a directory: $CONTEXT_DIR" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  if [ -z "$(find "$CONTEXT_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.md' -print -quit)" ]; then
    echo "create-goals: no .md files found in $CONTEXT_DIR — continuing with no context bundle" >&2
  fi
fi
```

- A `--dir` that is **set but missing** (or not a directory) is a hard error: print the message and exit non-zero **before any goal work begins**.
- A directory that **exists but contains no `.md` files** is NOT an error: warn and continue with an empty context bundle.
- When `CONTEXT_DIR` is unset, skip this step entirely and proceed to a normal interactive creation.

### Step 3: Load the context bundle (read-only)

If `CONTEXT_DIR` is set and contains `.md` files, enumerate and read them — **only files inside `CONTEXT_DIR`, never outside it**:

```bash
find "$CONTEXT_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.md'
```

Use `glob` to list the markdown files and `read_file` to load each file's contents into `CONTEXT_BUNDLE`. The bundle is **read-only** — consume it as reference material; never edit the source markdown (no `edit_file` / `write_file` on it), and never read files outside `CONTEXT_DIR`.

### Step 4: Route through the `stride-workflow` orchestrator

Follow the `stride-workflow` skill, passing the creation intent and the loaded context bundle. The orchestrator writes the activation marker and dispatches `stride-creating-goals` with the bundle forwarded verbatim:

```
intent=create-goals; description=<INTENT>; context_dir=<CONTEXT_DIR>; context_bundle=<CONTEXT_BUNDLE>
```

Do NOT activate `stride-creating-goals` yourself. The orchestrator is the only sanctioned path — it satisfies the sub-skill STOP gate by dispatching from inside itself, and it forwards the context bundle to the sub-skill, which mines it per its **Consuming Provided Context** section (populating both goal-level fields and each nested task). The context **augments** the user's interactive intent; it never silently overrides the user's confirmation, never relaxes the `"goals"` root-key or index-dependency rules, and never excuses leaving a required field (including the four review_queue-scored fields on every nested task) blank.

## Terminal state

This command's terminal state is **the goal and its tasks created** — not built. After the orchestrator dispatches `stride-creating-goals` and the goal/tasks are created, it reports the new `G###` / `W###` identifiers and **stops**. It does not claim, start, or implement any of the work, and it does not continue into a build loop. Newly created tasks land in the **Backlog** and become claimable only after a human promotes them to Ready. Building a created task is a separate, explicitly-invoked action — `/stride-build` (or a fresh request to work the task), which re-enters the `stride-workflow` orchestrator. See the orchestrator's **Creation Terminal State** section.
