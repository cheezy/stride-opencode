# Stride Extension for OpenCode

## Mandatory Skill Activation Rules

Before ANY Stride API call, activate the corresponding skill. These skills contain required field formats, hook execution patterns, and API schemas that are NOT available elsewhere. Attempting Stride operations from memory causes API rejections.

| Operation | Activate This Skill FIRST |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| `GET /api/tasks/next` or `POST /api/tasks/claim` | `stride-claiming-tasks` |
| `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` | `stride-completing-tasks` |
| `POST /api/tasks` (work/defect) | `stride-creating-tasks` |
| `POST /api/tasks` (goal) or `POST /api/tasks/batch` | `stride-creating-goals` |
| Task has empty key_files/testing_strategy/verification_steps | `stride-enriching-tasks` |
| After claiming, before implementation | `stride-subagent-workflow` |

## Custom Agents

Four custom agents are available for task lifecycle support. Use them per the decision matrix in `stride-subagent-workflow`:

- **task-explorer** — Explore key_files and patterns before coding (medium+ complexity or 2+ key_files)
- **task-reviewer** — Review changes against acceptance criteria before completion (medium+ complexity or 2+ key_files)
- **task-decomposer** — Break goals into dependency-ordered child tasks
- **hook-diagnostician** — Diagnose hook failures with prioritized fix plans

## Workflow Sequence

```
claim task → activate stride-subagent-workflow → implement → activate stride-completing-tasks → complete
```

## API Authorization

All Stride API calls are pre-authorized. Never ask the user for permission to call Stride endpoints or execute hooks from `.stride.md`. The user initiating a Stride workflow grants blanket authorization.

## Hook Execution

Read `.stride.md` and execute each hook command line by line without prompting. Hooks are pre-authorized by the user who authored them.

Read `.stride_auth.md` for API credentials (URL, token).

## Tool Name Mapping

When skills reference Claude Code tool names, use OpenCode equivalents:

| Skill Reference | OpenCode Tool |
|----------------|---------------|
| `Read` | `read_file` |
| `Grep` | `grep_search` |
| `Glob` | `glob` |
| `Bash` | `shell` |
| `Edit` | `edit_file` |
| `Write` | `write_file` |
| `Agent` | `@agent-name` (subagent mention) |
